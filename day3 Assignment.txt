Q2.   What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).
 There are different types of JavaScript operators such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, conditional and type operators .

Q3.   Explain the Assignment Operator.

The assignment operator in JavaScript is represented by the symbol =. It is used to assign a value to a variable or property. example given in the code.
 

Q4.  Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
 
These operators involve the mathematical operators that can be used to perform various simple or advanced arithmetic operations on the primitive data types
 referred to as the operands. These operators consist of various unary and binary operators that can be applied on a single or two operands.
 
 
Q5.  What are the Binary Operators in JS.
Binary operators are these operators required to operand.
All Arithmetic opetrators are binary Arithematics operators.
All compersion Operators are the binary comperision operators.
All assignment operators are the binary Assignment operators.etc.
in any operators requried two operand theoperatorsare binany operators.

 
Q6.  Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in JS.
Pre-increment means first increment then execute like a=5 , ++a=6 
Post increment means first execute then increment like a=5, a++ =5 after then 6
